styling

1. CSS stylesheet
2. Inline style
3. CSS modules
4. Styled Component


1. CSS stylesheet
 : seperate one file for css 
 simple to know megere my style is ( easy to cache)
  too much line of code , global scope

2. Inline : 
    style={{color:"red"}}
    red --> "red",
    : for testing
reusability , browser , few css properties can't be implemented

3 .Styled Component
 css in js 
 dynamic css property with use of props 
  : differetiate b/w styled compoenent and React compoenent
  : because we are using JS in css so we need to evalaute the expression then assign it to CSS , it will slow down performance
  : same file contains css and js

4. CSS modules 
  end file with name .module.css 
  class and id 
  which file need import style from "../file.module.css";
  className = {style.header}

  advantage 
   local scope
